    article_one: "<p>Lowering the voting age to 16 has been a topic of debate, but there are several compelling reasons why this would not be a good idea. While it's true that young people are passionate and involved in politics, they may not have the necessary experience or maturity to make informed decisions at the ballot box.</p> <p>Firstly, young people are still developing their critical thinking skills and may be more susceptible to manipulation or influence by others. A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that 18-year-old voters are less likely to have well-formed political opinions or to vote based on policy positions than older voters.</p> <p>Secondly, young people may lack the experience to fully understand the consequences of their vote. According to a 2020 survey by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, only 38% of 18-29 year olds reported following news about government and politics most of the time, compared to 55% of those over 65. Without a deep understanding of the issues and candidates, young people may make decisions based on surface-level factors, such as name recognition or popularity.</p> <p>Finally, young people have lower voter turnout rates than older age groups. According to the United States Election Project, only 46% of eligible voters aged 18-29 turned out to vote in the 2020 presidential election, compared to 71% of those aged 45-64. Lowering the voting age may not necessarily increase voter turnout or engagement, and may in fact dilute the voting power of those who are more experienced and engaged in the political process.</p> <p>In conclusion, while young people are an important and valuable part of the political process, lowering the voting age to 16 may not be the best way to engage them. Young people may lack the necessary experience or maturity to make informed decisions at the ballot box, and lowering the voting age may not necessarily increase voter turnout or engagement. Rather than lowering the voting age, efforts should be made to improve civic education and engagement among young people to prepare them for active participation in the political process.</p>",

    article_two: "<p>Lowering the voting age has been a topic of debate for many years. Many argue that young people are not mature enough to make informed decisions, but the data suggests otherwise. In fact, lowering the voting age to 16 could have significant benefits for democracy and youth engagement.</p> <p>Firstly, young people are often deeply invested in issues such as climate change, racial justice, and gun control, but they are not always given a voice in the political process. According to a 2021 survey by the Pew Research Center, 68% of 18-29 year olds believe that the government should do more to address climate change. By lowering the voting age, young people could have a greater say in the policies that affect their lives and the future of the planet.</p> <p>Secondly, research has shown that voting is a habit that is formed early in life. According to a study by the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, 82% of young people who voted in their first election went on to vote in the next presidential election. Lowering the voting age could help to establish a habit of civic engagement among young people, leading to increased voter turnout and more informed voters overall.</p> <p>Moreover, young people have historically been at the forefront of social and political movements, such as the Civil Rights Movement and the recent March for Our Lives movement against gun violence. By giving them a say in the political process, we could see a greater emphasis on issues that affect young people and the wider society.</p> <p>In conclusion, lowering the voting age to 16 could have significant benefits for democracy and youth engagement. Young people are often deeply invested in issues that affect their lives and the future of the planet, and by lowering the voting age, we could help to establish a habit of civic engagement early in life. With more informed and engaged voters, we could see greater progress on the issues that matter most.</p>"},

    article_two: "While mobile devices have undoubtedly revolutionized how we learn, communicate, and interact with the world around us, there are also some valid reasons why pre-teens should not have their own mobile devices at school. Here are some reasons why:</p> <p>Firstly, mobile devices can be a significant source of distraction for pre-teens during class time. A study by Common Sense Media found that 47% of pre-teens reported that they felt addicted to their mobile devices. This addiction can make it difficult for them to focus on their schoolwork, which can ultimately harm their academic performance.</p> <p>Secondly, mobile devices can expose pre-teens to inappropriate content, such as cyberbullying, violence, and sexual content. According to a study by the Cyberbullying Research Center, 34% of pre-teens have experienced cyberbullying, and 42% have seen online images that were not appropriate for their age. These negative experiences can have long-lasting impacts on their mental and emotional well-being.</p> <p>Thirdly, mobile devices can be expensive, and not all families can afford to buy them for their children. This can create inequalities in the classroom, where some pre-teens have access to more resources than others, leading to a potential divide in academic performance.</p> <p>Finally, pre-teens may be more susceptible to developing addictive behavior patterns with technology. A study by the American Academy of Pediatrics found that excessive use of mobile devices can lead to sleep deprivation, obesity, and other negative health outcomes.</p> <p>In conclusion, while mobile devices have numerous benefits, there are also valid concerns about their use by pre-teens at school. The potential for distraction, exposure to inappropriate content, financial inequality, and the risk of addiction are all factors that must be considered when deciding whether pre-teens should have their own mobile devices at school. It is important to weigh these concerns against the potential benefits of mobile devices and make informed decisions that prioritize the well-being of pre-teens.</p>"},

    article_one: "<p>While the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in education has been widely embraced, there are some potential downsides that cannot be overlooked. In this article, we will discuss why using AI tools for school work may not be the best option for students.</p> <p>Firstly, the use of AI tools in school work could lead to a decline in critical thinking skills. Students may become too reliant on AI tools to provide them with answers, rather than engaging in independent thinking and problem-solving. According to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 76% of teachers surveyed believed that students' dependence on technology was negatively affecting their critical thinking and analysis skills.</p> <p>Furthermore, using AI tools for school work could lead to a lack of creativity. According to research conducted by Microsoft, students who used AI tools to complete writing assignments scored lower on measures of originality and creativity compared to those who wrote without AI assistance. The researchers concluded that relying on AI tools to generate ideas and provide feedback could hinder students' ability to develop their own creative writing skills.</p> <p>Another potential downside of using AI tools in school work is the risk of inaccuracies. AI tools are only as reliable as the data they are trained on, and they can make errors or provide inaccurate information. A study conducted by Stanford University found that popular AI-powered language processing tools were biased against certain groups, such as African Americans and women, which could lead to inaccurate or discriminatory results.</p> <p>Lastly, there is a concern that using AI tools for school work could exacerbate existing inequalities. Students who do not have access to the latest technology or who cannot afford AI tools may be at a disadvantage compared to their wealthier peers. This could widen the digital divide and further disadvantage students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.</p> <p>In conclusion, while AI tools can provide some benefits for students, there are also potential downsides that cannot be ignored. Relying too heavily on AI tools could lead to a decline in critical thinking and creativity, the risk of inaccuracies, and further exacerbate existing inequalities. It is important for educators and policymakers to consider these potential downsides when deciding how to integrate AI tools in education.</p>",

        author_one: "Klaus Van Till",
        article_one: "<p>The idea of banning plastic, particularly single-use plastics, has gained widespread attention in recent years due to concerns about environmental pollution. However, an outright ban on plastic may not be the best solution and could cause unintended consequences that outweigh its benefits.</p> <p>Firstly, plastic is an incredibly versatile and cost-effective material. It plays a crucial role in industries like healthcare, where sterile plastic packaging helps prevent contamination of medical supplies. According to the American Chemistry Council, plastic accounts for only 10% of the total waste in the U.S., but it plays a critical role in minimizing food spoilage and extending shelf life. Without plastic, we may see an increase in food waste, which already makes up about 30% of all food produced globally, as reported by the United Nations.</p> Additionally, alternative materials like glass, paper, or metal are often touted as replacements for plastic. However, studies show that these alternatives can have higher environmental costs. For instance, a 2018 study by Denmark's Ministry of Environment and Food found that paper bags would need to be reused 43 times to match the environmental impact of a plastic bag. Glass and metal also require significantly more energy and resources to produce and transport.</p> <p>Rather than an outright ban, a more effective approach may be improving plastic recycling rates, which currently stand at only 9% globally, according to the United Nations. By investing in better waste management systems and encouraging responsible consumption, we can address the plastic problem without resorting to measures that may have unintended negative consequences for the environment and economy.</p>",
        title_two: "The World Will Be a Garbage Patch",
        author_two: "Belinda Bross & Callum Hargraves",
        article_two: "<p>Plastic pollution has become a significant environmental issue, and banning single-use plastics is a critical step in addressing this global crisis. The widespread use of plastics, particularly disposable items such as plastic bags, straws, and packaging, has led to alarming levels of pollution that harm ecosystems, wildlife, and human health.</p> <p>According to a 2018 report by the United Nations, over 8 million tons of plastic enter the oceans every year, contributing to the creation of massive \"garbage patches\" such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which covers an area twice the size of Texas. This pollution poses a severe threat to marine life, as millions of animals, including sea turtles, birds, and fish, are harmed or killed each year due to ingestion or entanglement in plastic waste. The World Economic Forum warns that by 2050, there could be more plastic in the ocean than fish by weight if current trends continue.</p> <p>Additionally, plastics take hundreds of years to decompose, releasing harmful chemicals into the environment and contributing to the contamination of soil and water. Microplastics, tiny fragments of degraded plastic, have been found in drinking water, food, and even the air we breathe. A study by the University of Newcastle in Australia estimates that the average person consumes around 5 grams of microplastic each week—the equivalent of a credit card.</p> <p>Banning single-use plastics would significantly reduce plastic waste, encourage the adoption of sustainable alternatives, and help mitigate the long-term environmental and health impacts of plastic pollution. By taking decisive action, we can protect ecosystems, reduce plastic waste, and ensure a cleaner, healthier planet for future generations.</p>"}
